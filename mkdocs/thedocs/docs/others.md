# iCub documentation

In here we have a first draft of iCub documentation

<!--
## Our first test site
In this [first site](https://icub-tech-iit.github.io/documentation/mkdocs/ztest00/site/ "iCub Tech Docs' firstborn") we just have
the example site generated with mkdocs with a basic style and some other graphic objects.

## The tendons in iCub
In this [document](https://icub-tech-iit.github.io/documentation/mkdocs/tendons_icub/site/ "Tendons in iCub") 
we have a technical description of iCub's tendons. 

It is our first effort in documentation. We have decided to begin with this because the information of how to assemble the steel cables which move our robot was scrambed around and needed a single entry point. We plan to improve this document by adding sections which tells how to change a tendon.

## The upgrade kits
The design of our robot evolves in time. We have been asking ourselves how to propagate the mechanical or hardare enhancements we design to older robots. Our solution is to define upgrade kits which apply to certain robots. 

An upgrade kit is a ... plastic bag with mechanical parts, hardware boards, screws, wires, tendons and whatever it is required to perform a physical upgrade of the robots. And surely the instructions.

Here are our first kits. 


###  iCub UPKT: hand
In  [here](https://icub-tech-iit.github.io/documentation/mkdocs/upkt/Hand_support/site/ "upKt iCub hands") we have description of how to perform an upgrade to the hands of iCub. The upgrade consists in replacing  the supports of the mais board and on a new cover..

<!--
###  iCub UPKT: mais support 
In  [here](https://icub-tech-iit.github.io/documentation/mkdocs/upkt/mais_support/site/ "upKt iCub mais support") we have description of how to perform an upgrade to iCub so that the supports of the mais board placed in its hands don't easily break anymore.
-->

###  iCub UPKT: eyes support 
In  [here](https://icub-tech-iit.github.io/documentation/mkdocs/upkt/eyes_support/site/ "upKt iCub eyes support") we have description of how to perform an upgrade to iCub so that the supports of the eyes make them more stable.

### iCub UPKT: torso capacitors 
In [here](https://icub-tech-iit.github.io/documentation/mkdocs/upkt/capacitors/site/ "upKt iCub capacitors") we have description of how to perform an upgrade to iCub so that the capacitors placed in its back don't get loose.

###  iCub UPKT: differential neck pulley 
In  [here](https://icub-tech-iit.github.io/documentation/mkdocs/upkt/differential_neck_pulley/site/ "upKt iCub differentail neck pulley") we have description of how to perform an upgrade to the neck of  iCub so that the tendon does not easily slip away.
