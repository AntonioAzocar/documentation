>1. Take a piece of non coated cable (more or less 40cm).
>2. Pass the cable trough the hole (H) in the pulley.      Optionally you can block the cable on the pulley putting a drop of      cyanoacrylic glue into the hole.
>3. Twine the cable on the pulley. The number of turns around      the pulley has to be decided on the basis of the entrance and exit holes      (H1 and H2): the cable should enter the holes tangentially.
>4. Insert the cable extremities, E1 and E2, in holes H1 and      H2 respectively.
>5. Pass E1 trough the tube T1. Pass E2 trough T2. Position      the extremities of the tube on the sockets of the holes H1 and H2 in the      motor support. Note: the tube extremity should be inserted correctly in      its socket.
>6. Pass E1 trough the tensioner and insert the tube T1      extremity in one of the tensioner socket. Pass E2 trough the tensioner and      insert the tube T2 extremity in one of the tensioner socket.

7. Pass E1 trough the tube T3. Pass E2 trough T4.
8. Pass E1 trough H3. Pass E2 trough H4. Position the      extremities of T3 and T4 on the sockets in correspondence of H3 and H4.
9. Put the thumb opposition in its fully extended limit.      Twine E1 around the pulley P1. Pass the cable ending E1 trough the hole H6      and exit from H5. Tension the cable by pulling E1 strongly. Check that all      the tube extremities are inside their sockets. Pass the cable ending E2      trough the hole H7 and exit from H5. Tension the cable pulling E2. Note: if inserting the cable into H6 and H7      results difficult, the thumb should be removed from the palm by unscrewing      S3 and S4. Additionally after this operation the pulley P1 can be made      more accessible by rotating it around the spindle Pin1.
10. Maintain the thumb opposition in its fully extended limit.      Pull E2 (the part of the tendon actuating the thumb opposition extension)      and block the cable on the joint with the screw S2. Note: do not block the cable with the screw S1.
11. Increase the cable tension with the help of the motor.      First try understand in which direction the motor should rotate to extend      the thumb. Rotate the motor in this direction by applying an increasing      voltage up to 5V. Since the thumb was already fully extended you should      not observe any evident movement. The only effect of this procedure is to      increase the tension of one side of the cable. Maintain the 5V until the      system is stationary.
12. Pull E1 in order to give tension to the other side of the      cable. While pulling block the cable with S1. 
13. Remove the power supply from the motor thus observing the      tension distributing equally on both sides of the cable.

!!! TIP
    

    Tensioning the cable is very important. Even when all the screws are not tight, it may results difficult to tension the cable in all its parts. This is due to the sharp edges of the pulley which do not allow a uniform distribution of the tension.

!!! note
    For proximal cablings it needs to mark with a suitable pen the cable most internal in the finger (palm opposite side). Then leave the cable and make a knot. Then you must pull the cable (the finger will be closed) and you can make the knot on the other cable nearest the palm, without marking with the pen.

Take a piece of coated cable (more or less 40cm).

>1. Tie in a knot at the extremity E2 of the cable.

2. Pass the cable trough the hole (H) in the pulley (P). 
3. Pass the cable trough the hole H1 of the motor support.      Position the knot at the extremity E2 on its socket S1 which is positioned      on the pulley P.
4. Pass E1 trough the tube T1. Note: the tube extremity      should be inserted correctly in its socket.
5. Pass E1 trough the hole H2. Position the tube extremity on      its socket in H2.
6. Perform a complete 360 deg turn around the pulley P1 (see      the detailed picture). 
7. Pass E1 trough the hole H3 and exit trough the hole H4.
8. Perform a complete 360 deg turn around the pulley P2 (see      the detailed picture).
9. Pass E1 trough the hole H5 and exit trough the hole H6. Note: the hole H6 is on a piece of metal that was      designed to be mounted with strain gauges in order to measure the cable      tension.
10. Pull the extremity E1 and be sure that all tubes extremity      are all inside their sockets.
11. Tie in a knot at the extremity E1 as close as possible to      the hole H6.
12. Rotate the motor and check that the finger extension works      correctly. Note: sometimes the finger      extension does not work properly because of the cable friction in      correspondence of the pulleys P1 and P2.

!!! TIP
     The knot of the finger proximal joint movement may increase the friction in correspondence of the cable at the position where the cable exits the hole H2. Always check that this is not the case.
    The joint can be moved by rotating the motor either in a clockwise or in a counter clock wise direction. However, only one of the two directions will correspond to a correct alignment of the cable with the hole H1. Always check that the cable is working properly (see pictures below: gray cable=correct, red cable= wrong) and that the motor rotates in the correct direction to close the finger(green=correct closure rotation, red = wrong closure rotation).
    The motor housing has two different holes (H1 and H1bis) which can be potentially used. Choose the one that will not be closed by the forearm support when the motor will be mounted.

    Middle and Pinkie
    

    Unique path through the big motor
    
    The two cables (middle and pinkie) pass through the same pulley
    making both 1 turn. The cable that exit from the little internal
    pulley is the middle one, the other that exit from the external
    little pulley is the pinkie one.

| T3    | 80(mm)                                                       | 0+L       | Exits the   motor case from the hole close to the ball bearing. |

| T5    | 112(mm)                                                      | 9         | Exits   from the slider (H10) and enters the finger which is closer to the hole. |

>This join differs from the others since its movement is realized with a slider. The motor rotates so as to move the slider (clockwise rotations correspond to moving the slider proximally, i.e. closer to the elbow). The slider pulls a couple of wires so as to close the ring and little fingers. 

 

>Let's first describe how to mount the cables that will move the slider mounted on the forearm.

>1. Take a piece of non coated cable (more or less 40cm).
>2. Pass the cable trough the hole (H) in the pulley.      Optionally you can block the cable on the pulley putting a drop of      cyanoacrylic glue into the hole.
>3. Twine the cable on the pulley. The number of turns around      the pulley has to be decided on the basis of the entrance and exit holes      (H1 and H2): the cable should enter the holes tangentially.
>4. Insert the cable extremities, E1 and E2, in holes H1 and      H2 respectively.
>5. Pass E1 trough the tube T1. Pass E2 trough T2. Position      the extremities of the tube on the sockets of the holes H1 and H2 in the      motor support. Note: the tube extremity should be inserted correctly in      its socket.
>6. Pass E1 trough the tensioner Te1 and insert the tube T1      extremity in one of the tensioner socket.

7. Pass E1 trough the tube T3.
8. Pass E1 trough H3 and H4. Pass E2 trough H5. Position the      extremities of T3 and T4 on the sockets in correspondence of H4 and H5.
9. Pass E1 trough H6 and E2 trough H7.
10. Pull the extremity E1 and check that all the tubes are      inside their sockets. Tie in a knot (on the cable side E1) at the level of      the hole H6. Rotate the motor in a clock wise manner so as to move the      slider closer to the elbow. In order to increase the cable tension rotate      the motor with an external power supply (more or less 5V) always in a      clock wise direction.
11. Pull the extremity E2 and check that all the tubes are      inside their sockets. Tie in a knot at the level of the hole H7. This knot      should be done as close as possible to the hole H8.
12. Remove the external power supply.

 

>Let's now describe how to set up the cables that will pull the tendons that close the fingers thanks to the slider movements.

>1. Take a piece of coated cable (more or less 15cm). Tie in a      knot at one extremity. Pass the other extremity (E1) trough the hole H8.      and pull it so as to  move the knot      on H8. -- Take a second piece of coated cable. Tie in a knot at one      extremity. Pass the other extremity (E2) trough the hole H9. and pull it      so as to  move the knot on H9.
>2. Pass E1 trough the hole H10. -- Pass E2 trough the hole      H11.
>3. Insert E1 trough the tube T4. Position the tube extremity      on the socket in H10. --Insert E2 trough the tube T5. Position the tube      extremity on the socket in H11.

 

>Let's now restrict to one of the two fingers (either pinkie or ring). Similar operations should be repeated for the other finger.

 

>1. Pass E1 trough the hole H12. Position the tube extremity      on its socket in H12.
>2. Perform a complete 360 deg turn around the pulley P1 (see      the detailed picture).

3. Pass E1 trough the hole H13 and exit trough the hole H14.
4. Perform a complete 360 deg turn around the pulley P2 (see      the detailed picture).
5. Pass E1 trough the hole H15 and exit trough the hole H16.
6. Perform a complete 360 deg turn around the pulley P3 (see      the detailed picture).
7. Pass E1 trough the hole H17 and exit trough the hole H18. Note: the hole H18 is on a piece of metal that      was designed to be mounted with strain gauges in order to measure the      cable tension.
8. Pull the extremity E1 and be sure that all tubes extremity      are all inside their sockets.
9. Tie in a knot at the extremity E1 as close as possible to      the hole H16.
10. Rotate the motor and check that the finger extension works      correctly.

!!!TIP
    Before connecting the sheath to the support insert and exit the cable, otherwise after this operation would be more complicated

TOOLS TO BE USED

\-         coated steel wire (Cod U7194561 Carl Stahl)

\-         set of small screwdrivers

\-         cyanoacrylic glue

\-         steel wire cutter

\-         set of hexagonal screw drivers

\-         power grippers

\-         tensioners (open cable version: CAD code ??????????)

 


> In this document we describe how to cable the wrist. The wrist movements (roll, pitch and yaw) are achieved with three motors located in the forearm. The wrist roll (or pronosupination) is achieved directly, i.e. without any cable driven joint.

 

> The wrist pitch and yaw are instead cable driven. The actuation is achieved with two motors which jointly collaborate to the pitch and yaw degrees of freedom. The actuation is differential with the following relationship:

 

> wrist_pitch = M1

> wrist_yaw = M1 + M2

 

> where M1 and M2 are the angular positions of the the two motors contributing to the movements. We have:

 

>**RIGHT_ARM**

>M1: angular position of 2B2M1

>M2: angular position of 2B2M2

 

>**LEFT_ARM**

>M1: angular position of 1B2M1

>M2: angular position of 1B2M2

!!! TIPS

    In order to increase the cable tension it is useful to unscrew the screws S1 and S2. After having completed all the described operations the cable tension can be increased by tightening the screws S1 and S2.

## 7. Broken Tendon on iCub V1 (secondo me da rimuovere)

### 7.1	Check Correct mounting the UPPER TENDON PART (Elbow side)

>4.1.1.	Make sure the cable is properly twined around the pulley P (red in the pic below)

<img src ="C:/iCub/Documentation/WIKI/mkdocs/tendons_icub/img/wrist/Broken_tendon_1.PNG" height = 400 width = auto>

> 4.1.2.	You might have to remove the proximal motors to have a clear view on pulley P.

> 4.1.3.	If you can assess the proper twining state around P, please skip to 6. Otherwise proceed with 4.

> 4.1.4.	To remove these motors just undo the screws shown in red below.

<img src ="C:/iCub/Documentation/WIKI/mkdocs/tendons_icub/img/wrist/Broken_tendon_2.PNG" height = 400 width = auto>

> 4.1.5.	You should now be able to get them out of the way (they will still be attached to their tendons) and get a clear view of the pulley. 

<img src ="C:/iCub/Documentation/WIKI/mkdocs/tendons_icub/img/wrist/Broken_tendon_3.PNG" height = 500 width = auto>

> 4.1.6.	The cable should be tangential to the pulleys as shown below.

<img src ="C:/iCub/Documentation/WIKI/mkdocs/tendons_icub/img/wrist/Broken_tendon_4.PNG" height = 500 width = auto>

> 4.1.7.	Block the cable on the motor with some tape. This will allow you to maintain the cable positioned on the pulley

!!! Tips
    We found ear-plugs are perfect for this scope cause they can be squeezed into position and then they will keep the tendon and prevent it from moving.

### 7.2	Gain some margin on cable tension

>4.2.1 Undo the small nuts on both sides of the tensioner and undo the tensioner extremities until they are as long as possible (only couple of threads screwed into the body of the tensioner)

<img src ="C:/iCub/Documentation/WIKI/mkdocs/tendons_icub/img/wrist/Broken_tendon_6.PNG" height =200 width = auto>

!!! note
    Note that RED nut and the RED extremity of the tensioner assembly are left hand-threaded (wrist side). Pay attention to the direction of turning.

>4.2.2.	Loosen the two screws that hold the motor in place. Do not remove them.

<img src ="C:/iCub/Documentation/WIKI/mkdocs/tendons_icub/img/wrist/Broken_tendon_6b.PNG" height =400 width = auto>


### 7.3	Replace the broken cable (wrist side)

>4.3.1.	Take a piece of cable 25 – 30 cm at least. Tie in a knot at one extremity. Drop some cyanoacrylate glue on the knot to make sure it will NOT get loose

>4.3.2.    Take the other extremity and pass it through the hole H1 on the pulley P3. Exit the pulley through the hole H2.

<img src ="C:/iCub/Documentation/WIKI/mkdocs/tendons_icub/img/wrist/Broken_tendon_7.PNG" height =300 width = auto>

>4.3.3	Pass the wire through the tensioner and mark with a permanent marker where the knot shall fall. This knot should be positioned taking into account the length of the tensioner.

>4.3.4.	Tight a knot and fix it using the usual drop of cyanoacrylate glue.

> 4.3.5.    The tensioner should be in the middle of the admissible range of movements.


###  7.4 Tight to perfection

4.4.1.	Tight the tensioner by screwing in the extremities

<img src ="C:/iCub/Documentation/WIKI/mkdocs/tendons_icub/img/wrist/Broken_tendon_8.PNG" height =165 width = auto>

4.4.2.	Tight back in the screw that hold the motor

<img src ="C:/iCub/Documentation/WIKI/mkdocs/tendons_icub/img/wrist/Broken_tendon_9.PNG" height =400 width = auto>

### 7.5.	Conclusion

>If the tendon is still too lose after using all the tensioner stroke and after tightening the screws you might have to start over. To find the proper level of tension compare with the other wrist.
