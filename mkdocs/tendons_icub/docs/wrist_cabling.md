!!! note
    Note that the cabling of (1,2) & (5,6) and (3,4) & (7,8) is identical for symmetry. 

!!! note
    Note also that cable E1 & E2 are indeed a **one cable** with two different labels at its extremities, as we will    see below.



### 1.2.2 Cabling

First of all, in order to increase the cable tension it is useful to unscrew the 2 couples of screws located as shown in the pictures below, depending on which cables we are working on. After having completed all the described operations the cable tension can be increased by tightening the screws again.

| <img src ="../img/wrist/Tendons_wrist_right.png" width=2000> <img src ="../img/wrist/Tendons_wrist_right_back.png"> | FIRST THING FIRST: </br>which side of the wrist is broken? the internal (refer to cables 1 to 4) or the external  one (refers to cables 5 to 8)? </br>Can you see the differences?</br>YOU may have guessed on your own but the answer is only that the external one is beneath the 3 proximal motors which makes it more  complicated to reach and repair apart from that it is **exactly identical** - so to proceed  we will first see how to move the proximal  motor if you need to repair the external wrist motor and follow up with the explanation  of the tendon in a more generical way  as both motor are wired the same way.</br>**If you need to repair tendons from 1 to 4  please just proceed to STEP 2** |
| <img src ="../img/wrist/Screws_lateral1.png" width=200>      | STEP 1:  remove the 6 screws M1.6x5 (?) and flip over the 3 motors to be able to access visually the motor beneath them. |
| <img src ="../img/wrist/Screws_lateral2.png" width=200>      | STEP 2:  remove or loose the 2 screws M2.5x10 (?) holding the motor. From now on you can work freely. |
| Tensioner pic? non so quale tensioner e codici               | STEP 3:  remove the broken part of the cable still inside the tensioner  !!!WARNING!!!  once remove, either you put back the brand new cable inside or else just simply gather the part removed from the tensioner assembly and re-screw it back in until further notice in order to DO NOT LOSE PIECES!!! |
|                                                              | **We can now start wiring!!!**                               |
| <img src ="../img/wrist/Hole_H.png" width=200>               | STEP 4: Let's begin with the motor pulley. Take a piece of uncoated cable (more or less 20 cm). Let its extremities be E1 and E2. Pass the cable trough the hole (H) in the pulley. Block the cable on the hole H with some cyanoacrylic glue. |
| foto con colori e labels E1 E2 - E5 E6                       | STEP 5: Twine the cable on the pulley. The number of turns around the pulley has to be decided on the basis of the entrance and exit pulleys: the cable should be tangential to the pulleys. Block the cable on the motor with some tape. This will allow you to maintain the cable positioned on the pulley. **Non ho capito come si avvolge (quanti giri)**. This wiring is identical for the cables E5-E6. |
| <img src ="../img/wrist/Hole_H3.png" width=200> <img src ="../img/wrist/Hole_H4.png" width=200> | **Wrist pulley (E3-E7):** take a piece of cable. Tie in a knot at one extremity.

This knot should be positioned so as to have the tensioner in the middle of the admissible range of movements. Repeat for cables E2 &E4. |

## 1.3 Passive tendons

### 1.3.1 Location & identification

From the pictures below you will be able to locate and identify the 2 tendons inside both the **Right Wrist** and **Left Wrist** building the passive part of the wrist movements. 

The **pink** cable is cable **9** and the **red** one is cable **10**.

| Left wrist                                            | Right wrist                                            |

### 1.3.2 Cabling

Here the sequence you need to follow to restore the 2 little cables from the base of the wrist - we will write down the procedure using the left arm as base pictures but use the previous pictures above to mirror the explanations.

| pictures                                      | step by step procedure                                       |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| <img src ="../img/wrist/Passive_cabling.png"> | !!!KEEP IN MIND - whenever you need to replace one of the 2 cables you **FIRST** need to release the tensioners . <br> Just put one side of the crimp of each cable inside its tensioner and follow the path until its blue stopper. |
| <img src ="../img/wrist/FIG20.png">           | Cable 9 needs to be inserted inside the hole H1, while cable 10 in the hole H2. |
| <img src ="../img/wrist/Stoppers.png">        | To block the cable ends you first need to unscrew the stopper, then insert the cable and screw it back. Tie in a knot in order to prevent any cable slippage. |
|                                               | Once done: tighten the screws of both tensioners until you reach a strict tensing on the cables. |

# 2. HAND

## 2.1 Location

The Hand wiring consists of the Thumb Oppose and the Fingers Abduction. In the picture below you can see where the cables are located.

TOOLS TO BE USED

\-         coated steel wire (Cod U7194561 Carl Stahl)

\-         set of small screwdrivers

\-         cyanoacrylic glue

\-         steel wire cutter

\-         set of hexagonal screw drivers

\-         power grippers

\-         tensioners (open cable version: CAD code ??????????)

 


> In this document we describe how to cable the wrist. The wrist movements (roll, pitch and yaw) are achieved with three motors located in the forearm. The wrist roll (or pronosupination) is achieved directly, i.e. without any cable driven joint.

 

> The wrist pitch and yaw are instead cable driven. The actuation is achieved with two motors which jointly collaborate to the pitch and yaw degrees of freedom. The actuation is differential with the following relationship:

 

> wrist_pitch = M1

> wrist_yaw = M1 + M2

 

> where M1 and M2 are the angular positions of the the two motors contributing to the movements. We have:

 

>**RIGHT_ARM**

>M1: angular position of 2B2M1

>M2: angular position of 2B2M2

 

>**LEFT_ARM**

>M1: angular position of 1B2M1

>M2: angular position of 1B2M2

## **4. Broken Tendon on iCub V1**

### **4.1.	Check Correct mounting the UPPER TENDON PART (Elbow side)**

>4.1.1.	Make sure the cable is properly twined around the pulley P (red in the pic below)

<img src ="../img/wrist/Broken_tendon_1.PNG" height = 400 width = auto>

> 4.1.2.	You might have to remove the proximal motors to have a clear view on pulley P.

> 4.1.3.	If you can assess the proper twining state around P, please skip to 6. Otherwise proceed with 4.

> 4.1.4.	To remove these motors just undo the screws shown in red below.

<img src ="../img/wrist/Broken_tendon_2.PNG" height = 400 width = auto>

> 4.1.5.	You should now be able to get them out of the way (they will still be attached to their tendons) and get a clear view of the pulley. 

<img src ="../img/wrist/Broken_tendon_3.PNG" height = 500 width = auto>

> 4.1.6.	The cable should be tangential to the pulleys as shown below.

<img src ="../img/wrist/Broken_tendon_4.PNG" height = 500 width = auto>

> 4.1.7.	Block the cable on the motor with some tape. This will allow you to maintain the cable positioned on the pulley

!!! Tips
    We found ear-plugs are perfect for this scope cause they can be squeezed into position and then they will keep the tendon and prevent it from moving.
    
<img src ="../img/wrist/Broken_tendon_5.PNG" height = 500 width = auto>
 
### **4.2.	Gain some margin on cable tension**

>4.2.1 Undo the small nuts on both sides of the tensioner and undo the tensioner extremities until they are as long as possible (only couple of threads screwed into the body of the tensioner)

<img src ="../img/wrist/Broken_tendon_6.PNG" height =200 width = auto>

!!! note
    Note that RED nut and the RED extremity of the tensioner assembly are left hand-threaded (wrist side). Pay attention to the direction of turning.

>4.2.2.	Loosen the two screws that hold the motor in place. Do not remove them.

<img src ="../img/wrist/Broken_tendon_6b.PNG" height =400 width = auto>


### **4.3	Replace the broken cable (wrist side)**

>4.3.1.	Take a piece of cable 25 – 30 cm at least. Tie in a knot at one extremity. Drop some cyanoacrylate glue on the knot to make sure it will NOT get loose

>4.3.2.    Take the other extremity and pass it through the hole H1 on the pulley P3. Exit the pulley through the hole H2.

<img src ="../img/wrist/Broken_tendon_7.PNG" height =300 width = auto>

>4.3.3	Pass the wire through the tensioner and mark with a permanent marker where the knot shall fall. This knot should be positioned taking into account the length of the tensioner.

>4.3.4.	Tight a knot and fix it using the usual drop of cyanoacrylate glue.

> 4.3.5.    The tensioner should be in the middle of the admissible range of movements.


###  **4.4 Tight to perfection**

4.4.1.	Tight the tensioner by screwing in the extremities

<img src ="../img/wrist/Broken_tendon_8.PNG" height =165 width = auto>

4.4.2.	Tight back in the screw that hold the motor

<img src ="../img/wrist/Broken_tendon_9.PNG" height =400 width = auto>

### **4.5.	Conclusion**
>If the tendon is still too lose after using all the tensioner stroke and after tightening the screws you might have to start over. To find the proper level of tension compare with the other wrist.
