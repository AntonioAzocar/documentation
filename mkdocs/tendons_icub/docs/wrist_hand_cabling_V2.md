!!! NOTE "SUM UP"
    Updating the forearm in V2 had had for consequences the following changes compared to the wiring of the V1 - Please refer to this manual to compel with the new attributes.

# 1	WRIST

## 1.1  WRIST TENDONS LENGTH

Here is the list of the 10 tendons needed to build the wrist movements.

## 1.2 Wrist motor tendons

From the pictures below you will be able to locate and identify the 8 tendons inside the **Right Forearm** building the active part of the wrist tendons.

From the pictures below you will be able to locate and identify the 8 tendons inside the **Left Forearm** building the active part of the wrist tendons.

## 1.6  Wrist - Passive tendons

### 1.6.1	Location and Identification

From the pictures below you will be able to locate and identify the 2 tendons inside both the **Right Wrist** and **Left Wrist** building the passive part of the wrist movements.

| RIGHT WRIST                                         | LEFT WRIST                                          |

### 1.6.2	Cabling

Here the sequence  you need to follow to restore the 2 little cables from the base of the wrist - we will write down the procedure using the left arm as base pictures but used the previous pictures above to mirror the explanations.

|pictures|step by step procedure|
| --- | --- |
|<img src="../img/HAND_WRIST_V2/wrist_tensionner.png" > </br><img src="../img/HAND_WRIST_V2/wrist_screws.png" > </br>|1. replacing the cable 10 is really straight forward: </br>just put one side of the crimp of cable 10 inside the tensionner (blue cirle) and put the other side inside the holding tooth - just make sure the tensionner is down by releasing the screw|
|<img src="../img/HAND_WRIST_V2/crimp_screw.png" >| 2. replacing cable 9 is just a tiny whinny more complicated becasue you need to first remove the screw to be able to lodge the crimp inside the tensionner and reput back in place the tensionner in the throat and insert the screw|
|<img src="../img/HAND_WRIST_V2/up_down.png" >| Once done: </br>3. tighten the screws of both tensionner until you reach a strict tensing on the cables|

# 2	Hand Wiring

!!! NOTE "SUM UP"
    You will find below a certain amount of pictures illustrating the changes or helping you to individuate the cabling and labelling of the different sheaths located in the hand.



## 2.1  Thumb Oppose

     Left palm, view from top - S0 and S2 cable from the thumb oppose

<img src="../img/HAND_WRIST_V2/Opposite_palm-view.png" width="700">

!!!NOTE
    The Right Thumb oppose sheath are the exact same just mirrored so the rule of the longest (S2) and the shortest (S0) is still the same.



## 2.1 Left THUMB



Here, you will find some rues to individuate the wiring and sheath for the wiring of the thumb oppose, the thumb proximal and distal.

## 2.2  Thumb Metacarpus sheath positions

!!! WARNING "REMINDER"
    The following list of sheaths are made from IITCODE :2375 - Open spiral spring, inox steel AISI302, D ext= 1.6mm, D wire= 0.25mm â€“ L = 500 mm:
    	- Distal Thumb
    	- Short Distal Thumb
    	- Short Prox Thumb
