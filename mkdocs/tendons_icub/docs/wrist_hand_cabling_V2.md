!!! NOTE "SUM UP"
    Updating the forearm in V2 had had for consequences the following changes compared to the wiring of the V1 - Please refer to this manual to compel with the new attributes.

# 1	WRIST

## 1.2 Wrist motor tendons
### 1.2.1	Location and Identification
From the pictures below you will be able to locate and identify the 8 tendons inside the **Right Forearm** building the active part of the wrist tendons.

</center>

From the pictures below you will be able to locate and identify the 8 tendons inside the **Left Forearm** building the active part of the wrist tendons.

### 1.2.2	Cabling

In the case you found out 1 of the 8 first cables of the wrist broken, here the sequence  you need to follow to restore the it.

| <img src= "/../img/HAND_WRIST_V2/Prox_screws1.png" width = 130%> | <u>STEP 1:</u> <br/> remove the 6 screws M1.6x5 and flip over the 3 motors to be able to access visually the motor beneath them. |
| <img src= "/../img/HAND_WRIST_V2/wrist_int_screws.png" width = 130%> | <u>STEP 2:</u> <br/> remove the 2 screws M2.5x10 holding the motor<br/>from now on you can work freely |
| <img src= "/../img/HAND_WRIST_V2/Tensioner_description.png" width = 130%> | <u>STEP 3:</u> <br/>remove the broken part of the cable still inside the tensioner <br/> !!!WARNING!!! <br/>once remove, either you put back the brand new cable inside or else just simply gather the part removed from the tensioner assembly and re-screw it back in until further notice in order to DO NOT LOSE PIECES!!! |

| | We can now start wiring!!! |

| put a picture showing that | <u>STEP 6:</u> <br/>put a 2 tie wraps one for each side (or cable) in order to prevent them from getting untwisted. |
| picture motor almost closed on support | <u>STEP 7:</u><br/>Put back in place the motor with its 2 screws M2.5x10. Leave 1mm in between the motor and the support. We will cover this aspect later |
|  | <u>STEP 8:</u><br/>let's wire the wrist pulleys (either for 1,2 or 5,6) |

## 1.3  Wrist - Passive tendons

### 1.3.1	Location and Identification

From the pictures below you will be able to locate and identify the 2 tendons inside both the **Right Wrist** and **Left Wrist** building the passive part of the wrist movements.

| RIGHT WRIST                                         | LEFT WRIST                                          |

### 1.3.2	Cabling

Here the sequence  you need to follow to restore the 2 little cables from the base of the wrist - we will write down the procedure using the left arm as base pictures but used the previous pictures above to mirror the explanations.

|pictures|step by step procedure|
| --- | --- |
|<img src="../img/HAND_WRIST_V2/wrist_tensionner.png" ></br><img src="../img/HAND_WRIST_V2/wrist_screws.png" > </br>|!!!KEEP IN MIND - whenever you need to replace one of the 2 cables you **FIRST** need to release the tensionners </br> <u>CABLE 10:</u> </br> it is really straight forward - just put one side of the crimp of cable 10 inside the tensionner (blue cirle) and put the other side inside the holding tooth|
|<img src="../img/HAND_WRIST_V2/crimp_screw.png" >| <u>cable 9: </u> </br> it is just a tiny whinny more complicated because you need to first remove the screw to be able to lodge the crimp inside the tensionner and reput back in place the tensionner in the throat and insert the screw|
|<img src="../img/HAND_WRIST_V2/up_down.png" >| Once done: </br>3. tighten the screws of both tensionner until you reach a strict tensing on the cables|

# 2	Hand Wiring

!!! NOTE "SUM UP"
    You will find below a certain amount of pictures illustrating the changes or helping you to individuate the cabling and labelling of the different sheaths located in the hand.



## 2.1  Thumb Oppose

     Left palm, view from top - S0 and S2 cable from the thumb oppose

<img src="../img/HAND_WRIST_V2/Opposite_palm-view.png" width="700">

!!!NOTE
    The Right Thumb oppose sheath are the exact same just mirrored so the rule of the longest (S2) and the shortest (S0) is still the same.



## 2.1 Left THUMB



Here, you will find some rues to individuate the wiring and sheath for the wiring of the thumb oppose, the thumb proximal and distal.

## 2.2  Thumb Metacarpus sheath positions

!!! WARNING "REMINDER"
    The following list of sheaths are made from IITCODE :2375 - Open spiral spring, inox steel AISI302, D ext= 1.6mm, D wire= 0.25mm â€“ L = 500 mm:
    	- Distal Thumb
    	- Short Distal Thumb
    	- Short Prox Thumb
