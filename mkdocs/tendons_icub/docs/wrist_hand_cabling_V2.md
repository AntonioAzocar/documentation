!!! NOTE "SUM UP"
    Updating the forearm in V2 had had for consequences the following changes compared to the wiring of the V1 - Please refer to this manual to compel with the new attributes.

# 1	WRIST

## 1.1  WRIST TENDONS LENGTH

Here is the list of the 10 tendons needed to build the wrist movements.

## 1.2  Wrist motor tendons

From the pictures below you will be able to locate and identify the 8 tendons inside the **Right Forearm** building the active part of the wrist tendons.

## ## 1.6 Wrist - Passive tendons

From the pictures below you will be able to locate and identify the 2 tendons inside both the **Right Wrist** and **Left Wrist** building the passive part of the wrist movements.

# 2	Hand Wiring

!!! NOTE "SUM UP"
    You will find below a certain amount of pictures illustrating the changes or helping you to individuate the cabling and labelling of the different sheaths located in the hand.



## 2.1  Thumb Oppose

     Left palm, view from top - S0 and S2 cable from the thumb oppose

<img src="../img/HAND_WRIST_V2/Opposite_palm-view.png" width="700">

!!!NOTE
    The Right Thumb oppose sheath are the exact same just mirrored so the rule of the longest (S2) and the shortest (S0) is still the same.



## 2.1 Left THUMB



Here, you will find some rues to individuate the wiring and sheath for the wiring of the thumb oppose, the thumb proximal and distal.

## 3.2  Thumb Metacarpus sheath positions

<img src="../img/HAND_WRIST_V2/Metacarpus.png">

!!! WARNING "REMINDER"
    The following list of sheaths are made from IITCODE :2375 - Open spiral spring, inox steel AISI302, D ext= 1.6mm, D wire= 0.25mm â€“ L = 500 mm:
    	- Distal Thumb
    	- Short Distal Thumb
    	- Short Prox Thumb



# 4 	Proximal Sheath - Position of the motor and labelling, cable routing

## 4.1  Position of the motors and labelling

| LEFT FOREARM                                                 | RIGHT FOREARM                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

!!!WARNING
    Please note that the proximal of the Left and Right Arm are symmetrical respect to the median plan of the body, meaning that index prox (7) is on the left side of the right forearm and on the right side of the left forearm.

## 4.2  Cable routing



Here an example of good routing for the left forearm. Useless to say that the Right needs to look like identical.
